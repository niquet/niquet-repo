# Design Doc
- Relatively informal documents that document the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on trade-offs that were consideredx
- They fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:
  - Original documentation of a software design
  - Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap
  - Achieving consensus around a design in the organization
  - Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns
  - Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization
  - Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions
  - Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s)
- Design docs don't follow a strict guideline for their content
- Rule #1: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project
- Certain structure has established itself useful:
  - **Context and Scope:** gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built; goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to; this section should be entirely focused on objective background facts
