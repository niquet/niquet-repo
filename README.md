# This is Where the Title of the Project Goes
Next, describe the project here. The project title should be descriptive and help people understand what the main goal and purpose of the project is in one sentence or less. The project description should explain and show what the application does, why it uses the technology it does, and some of the challenges it has faced and features it will implement in the future.

To avoid information overload, use the first three to five sentences of the README to give a brief introduction to the project. In addition, you can briefly mention and link to topics from the following sections of the project's README, where readers should be able to understand the what, why, and how of the project in detail. Use some of the guiding questions below:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you create this project?
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
- What makes your project unique?

Here's an example of an introduction:
